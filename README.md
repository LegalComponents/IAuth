iAuth
=======================

**Live Demo**: https://iauth.herokuapp.com

Features
--------

- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication** via Google, GitHub
- Flash notifications
- MVC Project Structure
- **Account Management**
 - Profile Details
 - Delete Account
- CSRF protection

Prerequisites
-------------

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth 1 -b iauth_app  https://github.com/LegalComponents/IAuth

# Change directory
cd IAuth

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

node app.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`npm install -g nodemon`.

Obtaining API Keys
------------------

To use the OAuth authentication methods, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.

- Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/console/project)
- Click on the **Create Project** button
- Enter *Project Name*, then click on **Create** button
- Then click on *APIs & auth* in the sidebar and select *API* tab
- Click on **Google+ API** under *Social APIs*, then click **Enable API**
- Next, under *APIs & auth* in the sidebar click on *Credentials* tab
- Click on **Create new Client ID** button
- Select *Web Application* and click on **Configure Consent Screen**
- Fill out the required fields then click on **Save**
- In the *Create Client ID* modal dialog:
 - **Application Type**: Web Application
 - **Authorized Javascript origins**: http://localhost:3000
 - **Authorized redirect URI**: http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
- Click on **Create Client ID** button
- Copy and paste *Client ID* and *Client secret* keys into `.env`

**Note:** When you ready to deploy to production don't forget to
add your new url to *Authorized Javascript origins* and *Authorized redirect URI*,
e.g. `http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com` and
`http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com/auth/google/callback` respectively.
The same goes for other providers.

Deployment
----------

### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku

<img src="http://blog.exadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/heroku-Logo-1.jpg" width="200">
- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the MongoLab add-on and configure the `MONGOLAB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.
