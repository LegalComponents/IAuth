### What is iAuth?

It is a basic library/ set of code to manage online identity in a better way.

It gives you a complete view of all the **Identity Service Providers (IDP)** that you have connected to the service and list of all the scopes that are available on the respective service.

It also provides you the freedom to revoke access to an IDP that you have already connected. This way you are in total control of what the service can access and not.
